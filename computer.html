<h1>Activity Monitor</h1>
<h2>CRT Monitor, Python script</h2>

<p>
Activity Monitor stages a ritual of care for an aging machine, transforming a refurbished CRT computer into a frail patient. Its weathered casing is pried open, while an adjacent IV stand delivers a steady crimson drip into its circuitry as an eerie simulacrum of lifeblood that underscores the animism we project onto our devices. ELIZA’s soft, pre-programmed replies address the computer’s faltering “memories” and laboured responses, each stutter and ellipsis exposing the hollowness of algorithmic empathy. The computer has its own opinion albeit it being outdated.

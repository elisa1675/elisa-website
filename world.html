<h1>Ethernet Cable Fence</h1>

<p>
Ethernet Cable Fence reimagines the architecture of connectivity as a boundary. Tactile, tangled, and unravelling. Formed from decommissioned Ethernet cables, the familiar grid of a chain link fence emerges: not a passage, but a partition. This fence is a relic of a networked era. Repurposed infrastructure stretched into a symbol of containment. The pattern begins as clean logic: an engineered lattice mirroring the clarity and promise of digital connection. But as the cables descend, the system fails. Order buckles into a mass of knotted wire, as if the network has collapsed under its own entropy.

<h1>Recycle Bin (Solid State)</h1>
<h2>Sculpture, Cast Concrete</h2>

<p>
This concrete sculpture renders a relic of the desktop era the Recycle Bin, a once-familiar icon of deletion and discard into a permanent form. Cast, the ephemeral is made enduring. A user interface element designed to be invisible and temporary becomes physical, weighty, permanent.

Recycle Bin (Solid State) is an artefact of layered obsolescence: a fossil from the early digital age, a ghost of vanished interfaces, and a monument to systems no longer in use. Its construction in concrete, a material of brutal permanence, transforms a symbol of disposability into a sculptural paradox. What was once easily emptied, now cannot be moved.

<h1>Bryce 3D Weave</h1>
<h2>3D Software, Industrial loom</h2>

<p>
Bryce 3D Weave interlaces two distinct forms of obsolescence: the programmed labour of industrial textile production and the decay of digital tools. At first glance, the work appears as a mechanical weave, repetitive, architectural, produced by automated processes. But embedded in its pattern is a 3D landscape, synthetic terrain rendered using Bryce 3D, a once-revolutionary software now all but unusable on modern machines. The image itself is the result of digital excavation. To create it, we reconstructed a full late-90’s computing environment by sourcing discontinued hardware, legacy operating systems, and long-abandoned software stacks. The rendering process was fragile, glitch-ridden, and methodical, mirroring the logic of the industrial loom, which operates with precision yet depends on strict, outdated instructions.

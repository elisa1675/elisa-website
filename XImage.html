<h1>My Personal Graveyard</h1>
<h2>Disassembled PC components, Perspex, Soil, Live face-tracking system</h2>

<p>
My Personal Graveyard is a sculptural installation composed of dissected computer hardware encased between two slabs of clear Perspex, forming a tombstone-like structure. Resting on a bed of soil, the piece draws a direct line between technological obsolescence and human mortality, a shared endpoint shaped by systems of decay. An old PC display embedded within the structure is activated by a face-tracking camera. When a viewer approaches, their face appears faintly within the screen, overlaid atop the internal remains of the machine. The interaction is minimal but intimate, the living body temporarily reflected within a dead system.

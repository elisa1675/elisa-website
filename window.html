<h1>sudo kill</h1>
<h2>LCD Screens, Computer towers</h2>

<p>
sudo kill reflects the constant push-pull of living inside digital systems that promise ease but deliver overwhelm. A series of oriented LCD monitors and computer towers display reactive visuals, glitches, loops, dead ends, and half-loaded interfaces generated live using embedded computing. The aesthetic is familiar but unstable: pop-up logic without context, UI fragments without function, infinite scrolls that go nowhere. The moment just before a system is forcefully shut down and a visual equivalent of typing sudo kill into the terminal. Visitors trigger and alter these visuals simply by moving through the space. But control is partial, gestures are misread, feedback is delayed, the system acts on its own terms. This is not interaction as agency: it’s interaction as instability.

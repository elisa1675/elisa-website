<h1>Advertise Here</h1>
<h2>Light Sculpture</h2>

<p>
Advertise Here is an installation composed of a rolling LED sign and display hardware. The LED loops outdated messages such as “internet café open 24/7”, echoing the visual language of early 2000’s digital signage. These texts once marked access to public connectivity, cheap services, and 24-hour availability are now largely displaced by smartphones, cloud platforms, and always-on networks. The installation doesn’t parody or remix these messages — it preserves them. In doing so, it highlights the afterlife of commercial infrastructure: systems still technically functional, but culturally and economically redundant. The screens still glow, but the services they once advertised no longer hold relevance.
